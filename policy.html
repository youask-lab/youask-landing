            <p>
              We, at YouAsk, are committed to ensuring the proper and fair use of our
              platform and services. This General Usage Policy applies to individuals
              who access or use the services offered on our platform. The policy
              outlines the guidelines and processes related to the usage of our platform
              and its features. For the purpose of this policy, “You” or “Your” shall
              refer to the person visiting or using the platform. “We,” “our,” and “us”
              refer to YouAsk. Here are the steps to avail the service benefits and key
              points to keep in mind while using the service on YouAsk.
            </p>

            <p>
              Bookings must be made at least 6 hours prior to the scheduled session
              start time. If the time remaining is less than 6 hours, the session will
              no longer be available for booking. Sessions may be booked up to 7 days in
              advance.
            </p>

            <p>
              The end user may join the session up to 5 minutes before the scheduled
              start time. If the end user is unable to attend at the scheduled time or
              leaves the session prematurely, the host is required to wait for a minimum
              of 10 minutes before ending the session, or for the remaining time left in
              the session, whichever is shorter.
            </p>

            <p>
              The end user may cancel the booking up to 12 hours before the scheduled
              session start time and will receive a 90% refund of the amount paid.
              Cancellations made within 12 hours of the scheduled session will not be
              eligible for any refund.
            </p>

            <p>
              The host may cancel the session up to 30 minutes before the scheduled
              start time. In such cases, the amount paid by the end user will be
              refunded in full to their account.
            </p>

            <p>
              If both the end user and the host fail to attend the scheduled session,
              the amount paid will be refunded to the end user’s account.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the end user is dissatisfied with the service provided, they may raise
              a dispute within one day of receiving the service. The internal team will
              review the matter and make a determination based on the circumstances. If
              appropriate, a refund will be issued to the end user’s account.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the end user ends the session before the scheduled end time due to an
              issue and raises a dispute within one day, the internal team will review
              the case. Based on their assessment, the end user may be refunded up to
              50% of the amount paid, or a higher amount depending on the situation. The
              final refund amount will be determined following the internal team’s
              evaluation.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the host is unable to provide the service as agreed, the full amount
              paid will be refunded to the end user’s account.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the event of technical issues, network problems, power failures, or
              hardware malfunctions on the host's end, leading to early termination of
              the session, the end user may raise a dispute within one day. The internal
              team will assess the situation, and if appropriate, a partial refund will
              be issued to the end user’s account.
            </p>

            <p>
              If a dispute is raised and, following a thorough investigation, the
              internal team determines that the host failed to provide the service with
              all necessary information, the host will not receive payment. The full
              amount paid by the end user will be refunded, and the refund will be
              processed within 2 working days.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon successful completion of a service, the payment made by the end user
              will be transferred to the host's account within 2 working days.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the referral service, the end user has the opportunity to connect with
              the host and discuss relevant details related to the service. However,
              please note that the decision to proceed with the referral ultimately
              rests with the host. The host has the discretion to decide whether or not
              to move forward with the referral, based on their own criteria or
              assessment of the situation.The end user may discuss their needs,
              preferences, and any relevant details with the host during the session,
              but the referral process will only be completed at the host's discretion.

      points to keep in mind while using the service on YouAsk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bookings must be made at least 6 hours prior to the scheduled session
      start time. If the time remaining is less than 6 hours, the session will
      no longer be available for booking. Sessions may be booked up to 7 days in
      advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The end user may join the session up to 5 minutes before the scheduled
      start time. If the end user is unable to attend at the scheduled time or
      leaves the session prematurely, the host is required to wait for a minimum
      of 10 minutes before ending the session, or for the remaining time left in
      the session, whichever is shorter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The end user may cancel the booking up to 12 hours before the scheduled
      session start time and will receive a 90% refund of the amount paid.
      Cancellations made within 12 hours of the scheduled session will not be
      eligible for any refund.
    </p>

    <p>
      The host may cancel the session up to 30 minutes before the scheduled
      start time. In such cases, the amount paid by the end user will be
      refunded in full to their account.
    </p>

    <p>
      If both the end user and the host fail to attend the scheduled session,
      the amount paid will be refunded to the end user’s account.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the end user is dissatisfied with the service provided, they may raise
      a dispute within one day of receiving the service. The internal team will
      review the matter and make a determination based on the circumstances. If
      appropriate, a refund will be issued to the end user’s account.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the end user ends the session before the scheduled end time due to an
      issue and raises a dispute within one day, the internal team will review
      the case. Based on their assessment, the end user may be refunded up to
      50% of the amount paid, or a higher amount depending on the situation. The
      final refund amount will be determined following the internal team’s
      evaluation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the host is unable to provide the service as agreed, the full amount
      paid will be refunded to the end user’s account.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event of technical issues, network problems, power failures, or
      hardware malfunctions on the host's end, leading to early termination of
      the session, the end user may raise a dispute within one day. The internal
      team will assess the situation, and if appropriate, a partial refund will
      be issued to the end user’s account.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a dispute is raised and, following a thorough investigation, the
      internal team determines that the host failed to provide the service with
      all necessary information, the host will not receive payment. The full
      amount paid by the end user will be refunded, and the refund will be
      processed within 2 working days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon successful completion of a service, the payment made by the end user
      will be transferred to the host's account within 2 working days.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the referral service, the end user has the opportunity to connect with
      the host and discuss relevant details related to the service. However,
      please note that the decision to proceed with the referral ultimately
      rests with the host. The host has the discretion to decide whether or not
      to move forward with the referral, based on their own criteria or
      assessment of the situation.The end user may discuss their needs,
      preferences, and any relevant details with the host during the session,
      but the referral process will only be completed at the host's discretion.
